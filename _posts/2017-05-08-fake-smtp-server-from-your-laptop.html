<h2 class="heading-sm">WHY?</h2>
<p>Because no developer and manager wants to send emails to real customers during testing and development stage.</p>
<h2 class="heading-sm">HOW?</h2>

{% highlight shell %}
python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:1025
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight shell %}
python -m SimpleHTTPServer <port>
{% endhighlight %}
