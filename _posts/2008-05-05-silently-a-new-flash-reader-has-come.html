<p>This evening I went to <a title="MahShelf" href="http://www.mahshelf.com" target="_blank">mahshelf.com</a> to read my favorite books and immediately I was surprised by the new fancy flash reader. It looks neat and some features have been added to make it more convenient for the users, i think. I really like the new one and perhaps the quality of images has been improved too, or something happens to my eyes :p</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I am speding time developing some new features and reading more books. I just can't help reading books, I am so addicted. Hope I one day will come up with the best and most optimized algorithm to serve PDF file in the system.</p>
