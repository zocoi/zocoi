    class=\"reblogged-content\">\n\nMy notes from Ursula LeGuin's essay about Hans
    Christian Andersen and Jung, from her book \"The Language of the Night\", \"The
    Child and the Shadow\"\r\n\r\n<blockquote>If the ego \"is weak, or if it's offered
    nothing better, what it does is identify with the \"collective consciousness.\"
    That is Jung's term for a kind of lowest common denominator of all the little
    egos added together, the mass mind, which consists of such things as cults, crees,
    fads, fashions, status-seeking, conventions, received beliefs, advertising, pop
    cult, all the isms, all the ideologies, all the hollow forms of communication
    and \"togetherness\" that lack real communion or real sharing. The ego, accepting
    these empty forms, becomes a member of the \"lonely crowd\". To avoid this, to
    attain real community, it must turn inward, away from the crowd, to the source:
    it must identify with its own deeper regions, the great unexplored regions of
    the Self. These regions of the psyche June calls the \"collective unconscious,\"
    and it is in them, where we all meet, that he sees the source of true community;
    of felt religion; of art, grace, spontaneity, and love.\r\n\r\nThat mass mind
    is \"stuffed full of the one-sided, shadowless half-truths and conventional moralities\"
    \r\n\r\nJung wrote;\" Everyone carries a shadow, and the less it is embodied in
    the individual's conscious life, the blacker and denser it is.\"  The less you
    look at it, in other words, the stronger it grows, until it can become a menace,
    an intolerable load, a threat within the soul. Unadmitted to consciousness, the
    shadow is projected outwards, onto others. There's nothing wrong with me--it's
    them. I'm not a monster, other people are monsters. \r\n\r\nIf the individual
    wants to live in the real world, he must withdraw his projections; he must admit
    that the hateful, the evil, exists within himself. This isn't easy. It is very
    hard not to be able to blame anybody else. \r\n\r\nIf one were to deal with his
    own shadow, he hasâ€¦.grown toward true community, and self-knowledge, and creativity.
    For the shadow stands on the threshold. We can let it bar the way to the creative
    depths of the unconscious, or we can let it lead us to them. For the shadow is
    not simply evil. It is inferior, primitive, awkward, animallike, childlike; powerful,
    vital, spontaneous. It's not weak and decent, like the learned young man from
    the North; it's dark and hairy and unseemly; but, without it, the person is nothing.
