<p>Another month has passed and we are glad to inform you that we have made various major improvements to MahShelf. We hope you enjoy your stay, and we will come back soon with more frequent updates.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explore</strong>: Yes! All 3 main categories (Comics, Manga, Others) are now in one place: the <em>Explore </em>tab. We have also made some changes with the sorting mechanism so you can find comics much easier.</li>
<li><strong>RSS Feed</strong>: Also in the <em>Explore </em>tab, you can now subscribe to each category to get the latest comics uploaded to MahShelf.</li>
<li><strong>Forums</strong>: As you can see, we have added a <em>Community </em>tab, with the whole new forums so everyone can go there and discuss whatever you want.</li>
<li><strong>Chat room</strong>: The Community tab has one public chat room. So if you feel bored, go there and shout out something :D</li>
<li><strong>Profile Info</strong>: More things for you to fill in and tell others more about yourself. Check your account and see the <em>Profile </em>section next to the <em>Setting </em>section.</li>
</ul>
