<p>Bad news!</p>
<p>I have been wondering why my face start turning red after the first sip of alcohol and the condition runs in my family. It turns out that I have <a title="ADH1B" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADH1B" target="_blank">ADH1B</a> gene coding which causes alcohol flush reaction. Here is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_flush_reaction" target="_blank">article from Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>The gene results in an inhibited acetaldehydedehydrogenase enzyme, responsibile for the breakdown of acetaldehyde, the main substance produced by oxidation of ethylene glycol, a.k.a alcohol.</p>
<p>It is worse that people with that gene may be at a higher risk for alcohol-related diseases, such as liver and esophageal cancers and digestive tract cancer.<sup id="cite_ref-SB_11-0"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_flush_reaction#cite_note-SB-11"><br />
</a></sup></p>
<p>From now on, I just have to reduce the consumption of alcohol, or better, do not consume alcohol at all.</p>
<p>Sorry friends! I know it's awkward to have sober guy at the table but it has to be done.</p>
