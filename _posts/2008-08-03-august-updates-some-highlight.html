<p>We have made a lot of changes around here for the past 3 weeks. First of all, as you can see, we have a <em><strong>"Feedback us" tab</strong></em> floating in the down right corner. You can send us anything from ideas to improve MahShelf.com or some errors occurred while using the site. We always appreciate your opinions and will do our best to improve this service the way you want it to be.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-39" title="Feedback us" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/clip_21.jpg" alt="" width="443" height="114" /></p>
<p>Now to the good stuff...our <strong><em>Flash reader</em></strong> has been upgraded once more. It rocks! I won't tell you everything we have done with it, as you can find them out yourself later. But here's the <strong>best part</strong>: when you read to the end of a comic book, other related books will appear right inside the Flash reader. So now you don't have to switch between <em>Fullsceen mode</em> and <em>Normal mode</em> whenever you finish reading a book.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41" title="RelatedBooks" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/clip1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="315" /></p>
<p>Reading in Fullscreen mode is the best! And with this improvement, you will find it most convenient reading comics, manga and other graphic novels here at MahShelf.com.</p>
<p>Also, check out our <a href="http://wiki.mahshelf.com/doku.php" target="_blank">Wiki page</a>. You can access it by clicking the "Help" link on the top right corner of the site. This is where every usage of MahShelf.com will be listed and instructed. Your contribution in this page is mostly welcomed.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-42" title="wikipage" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/clip_31.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="46" /></p>
<p>And to sum things up, we are very happy with this update. The future of reading comics online become a popular trend is within our sight. Thank you for your supports!</p>
