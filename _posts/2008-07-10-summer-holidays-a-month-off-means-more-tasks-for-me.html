<p>Hi, long time to see in this blog. And that was because I have been in my summer holidays in Espoo, Finland. It is such a nice city though there was not many interesting activities there. For me, hanging out with friends is enough fun.</p>
<p>Here is the list of things happened while I am away:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tasks, tasks, more tasks are coming and I have no choice but to finish it in order to keep up with the schedule.</li>
<li>A brand new <a title="Diễn đàn sinh viên Việt Nam tại Phần Lan" href="http://www.vsaf.org/forum/index.php" target="_blank">forum for Vietnamese students in Finland</a>. It was created with the passion to replace the old one which is not quite well-organized and supported. Take a look and enjoy yourself there. :D</li>
</ul>
<p>Updated: Looks like the old admin board did not accept to migrate to the new one. I agree that the old one has been the playground for the early students for a while and it has a great impact on them. But why did not they realize that the old fun time just passed away, the playground is rotten because of the way they administrated it: full of irrelevant posts in some important forums, no connection with other Vietnamese students in other cities and absolutely no help to the newcomers.</p>
<p>I heard that the only (functional) admin shares no access to the control panel to the other admin. Therefore he is the one who responsible to upgrade, react on emergency and have total control on the backend. If that was true then I do not have anything to say more, a communist forum, ehr ?</p>
<p>Hmm, feel free to post comments here :)</p>
