<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>Thanks for visiting MahShelf! We have been most impressed with the recent number of visits from our users. In this month we will keep releasing even more cool new features for reading and sharing digital comics online.</p>
<p>So, first off, we are extremely happy with the feedback we've known so far. We are determined to make digital comics become the most popular trend on the internet, and also, to turn digital comics publishing into a profitable business. That said, please continue to let us know if there's something you'd like us to improve. Just try suggesting something to us, and we'll prove how much we value your ideas and opinions.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the new changes. Last month, we've added many improvements to the site. Some major ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New explore page and reading trend feature<br />
</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We've been receiving many uploads each day. While this is really exciting, we realized that many visitors don't know where to start reading or discuss. Therefore, we bring you the new explore page, which can be accessed by clicking on the "<em><strong>view all</strong></em>" link besides the "<strong>Books currently being read</strong>" in main page. From there, you can easily find the most recent, most viewed, most rated and most discussed books.</p>
<p>Also, main page of MahShelf has a feature called "<strong>Reading trends</strong>", which shows particularly topics that areÂ  favored by other readers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reading history<br />
</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Suddenly forget what you've finished reading? You can use the "<strong>History</strong>" feature to help you quickly turn to the books you've read. This feature only available when signed-in.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Book updates<br />
</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When you subscribe to other users (Or add them as friends), you will receive notificatons of their new uploads in your "<strong>Account</strong>" page.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Send message<br />
</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Sending personal messages to other users in MahShelf is now possible.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Display name<br />
</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>So, sometimes you just want to change your nickname, eventhough you don't want to change the account name. Now you can modify it from your <strong>Account </strong>page, in the "<strong>Profile</strong>" tab.</p>
