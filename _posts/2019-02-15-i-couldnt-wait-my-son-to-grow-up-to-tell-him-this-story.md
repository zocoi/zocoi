Being a new dad and I started to subscribe to more dad/parentship question on Quora, today this story was really standing out:

# [What is the best piece of advice you ever received to earn more money?](https://qr.ae/TUKRCO)

I just gave this lesson to my 10-year-old son.

*“Dad, to make money I will be walking our neighbors’ dogs. How much should I charge?”*

*“How much do you want to make?”* I asked.

*“I think I could charge $3 dollars per hour.”*

*“Is that all you want to make? Only $3 dollars per hour?”*

*“No!”* he interrupted, *“I would love to make $20 dollars, but how could I do that? Do you think people will pay me $20?”*

**I started to work on his mindset:**

*“What are you selling, Son?”*

He stopped staring at me thinking, *“I’m not selling anything, Dad. What do you mean?”*

*“Okay,”* I said, *“pretend I’m your customer. Sell to me.”*

He ran quickly to the computer and printed out a brochure he created that said:

I WALK YOUR DOG $3 PER HOUR. CALL ME.

*“Here, Dad,”* giving me the brochure, *“will you hire me to walk your dog?”*

***“Listen, son, you are selling your time and that is wrong! Stop thinking like that and start selling me benefits. Try again!”***

*“I don’t understand!”*

*“What are the benefits I will get if you walk my dog? Sell me those!”*

*“Well, when I walk your dog, he will exercise, I will play with him and he will be happy.”*

*“I don’t care about those! I can also walk my dog and play with him. Now, try harder. What valuable things can you do during that same hour with my dog?”*

*“I could train him tricks and I could give him a bath.”*

*“YES!”* I said excited, *“how much would you charge for a bath?”*

*“I could not only walk the dogs, I could also bathe them and teach them tricks!”*

*“How much time will it take to bathe a dog?”* I asked.

*“Oh, I could do that in about 15 minutes!”*

*“So you will be making much more for the same hour, correct?”*

*“Yes, Dad… I get it, thanks!”* he replied as he ran to the computer to modify his brochure.


New problem: He’s only charging $3 dollars for a bath… haha!

He needs to feel the pain of hard work; then I will teach him how to better price his delivered value :)

To answer your question: What's the best advice you’ve received to make more money?

**There’s only one way to make more money. Start charging for delivered value, not for your time.**

This demands a new mindset. I challenge you to think:

**What benefits are your employer or your customers receiving with your work?**

Negotiate and sell the value you deliver.
