<p>Today my feature branch could not be merged to master because one my commit message did not meet the merging requirements. This is how I dived into a haystack, found the commit, rebased and upated it.</p>
<p>First, let's find all the commits made by me 2 days ago</p>
<p>[code]<br />
git log --since=2.days --author=hung<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>[code]<br />
commit 5e18ea5bd6b92d2382a545b07e3495c693fa6293<br />
Author: Hung Dao<br />
Date: Fri Nov 16 12:15:55 2012 -0800</p>
<p>sample commit message 1</p>
<p>commit d3727aafbadbd7befde0dd497afec3427f0bf151</p>
<p>Author: Hung Dao<br />
Date: Mon Dec 3 12:57:12 2012 -0800</p>
<p>sample commit message 2</p>
<p>...<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Git doesn’t have a tool to modify history, so in order to modify a commit that is farther back in my history, there is the rebase tool to rebase a series of commits onto the HEAD. I must also define how far I want to go back and rewrite history. For this case, I want to go 1 step further than the culprit commit</p>
<p>[code]<br />
git rebase -i d3727aaf~1</p>
<p>edit d3727aa change the commit message<br />
pick ....</p>
<p># Rebase dcfa286..5e18ea5 onto dcfa286<br />
#<br />
# Commands:<br />
#  p, pick = use commit<br />
#  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending<br />
#  s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit<br />
#<br />
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.<br />
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.<br />
#</p>
<p>Successfully rebased and updated ...<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Since the commits are listed in oposite order compared to chronological order I see in `git log`, the commit I want to change should be the first one. After rebasing, let's run `git log` one more time to confirm the change was there.</p>
<p>[code]<br />
git log --since=2.days --author=hung<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>And voilà! </p>
<p>Warning: Since it was only me who's working on the branch so I can do `git push --force origin `. It is strongly recommended not to rewrite history of a collaborative branch or repo since it may throw away other people's commits. </p>
