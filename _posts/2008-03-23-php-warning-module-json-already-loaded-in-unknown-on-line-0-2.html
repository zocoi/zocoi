<p>"PHP Warning: Module *** already loaded" seems to be a very common warning for freshly installed PHP. If you happen to see the example below here then this post may help you</p>
<p>[code]PHP Warning:  Module 'json' already loaded in Unknown on line 0[/code]</p>
<p>In this case, the reason may be that the modules json is loaded twice, look into the php.ini files and find this line and comment it out with a comma</p>
<p>[code];extension=json.so[/code]</p>
<p>Don't forget to look into both /etc/php5/cli and /etc/php5/apache2 if the warning appears both in your command line and web server.</p>
<p>There is a chance that you have installed the php5-json package in your Linux system and it also enable the extension somewhere in a config file therefore the duplication occurs. I would recommend to use the package from your distro repositories to make sure that everything is up to date.</p>
