<p>Phew, the last 3 weeks sure are busy. We have been working on a lot of advanced features to enhance our users' experience. This update consists of design retouching, small changes we have made, and reply to some feedbacks from everybody. So, here goes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enlarge button returns</strong>: since the last time we took down this feature because of some conflicts in the codes, many users have mentioned about putting it back, as reading in fullscreen ignores other things going on such as instant messages and mail notifications. So now it has been repaired, and has yet to show any error. One thing should be noticed though: after clicking the <em>Enlarge </em>button, an extra click on the <em>Flash reader</em> is required. If you try to roll the mouse wheel right after clicking the <em>Enlarge </em>button, your web browser will immediately exit the enlarge state.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Better exploring</strong>: there has been a problem that everyone doesn't know what to read and what's hot right now. So we have decided to change the 3 tabs <em>Comics</em>, <em>Manga </em>and <em>Others </em>to display <strong>all </strong>books, <strong>instead of just featured</strong> ones. They are sorted in terms of Book views (Most popular), Book rates (Most rated), Number of comments (Most discussed) and Date added (Latest)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>IE6 issue</strong>: oh yes. There have been a hell lot of bugs of MahShelf in IE6. We are really sorry for the bad experience you had. But for now please bear with us and upgrade your web browser to a newer version, or switch to Firefox or Google Chrome. Thank you for your patience!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>CBR and CBZ issue</strong>: unfortunately for security reasons, we can not accept CBR and CBZ, or RAR and ZIP file types right now. But you can always rename the CBR and CBZ files you have to RAR and ZIP, extract them and upload to MahShelf for now. We will try our best to solve this issue in the near future.</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy reading!</p>
<p>MahShelf editor team</p>
