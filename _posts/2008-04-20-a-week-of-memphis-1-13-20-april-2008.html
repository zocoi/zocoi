<p>Yeah, this type of blogging is copied from other blog but I think it's cool to remind what I have done or at least my friends can keep up to my work. Make a comment if anything went wrong here :P . Ok, in the previous week, I did:</p>
<ol>
<li>Deploy a new production server.</li>
<li>Write a php script to clean redundant files on that server.</li>
<li>Solve DNS problem with the domain.</li>
<li>Install memcache on my test server.</li>
<li>Convert real link from text in  the book description, for example: mahshelf.com now becomes <a href="http://mahshelf.com" target="_blank">http://mahshelf.com</a>.</li>
<li>Change page title dynamically to improve page SEO.</li>
<li>Make a presentation about Web 2.0 user interface at EVTEK school and receive lots of criticisms about that :( .</li>
<li>Think about my mom, forex rates showed <span class="result_msg"><span class="result_val">1</span> Euro = <span class="result_val"> 26,058.5</span> Vietnamese Dong yesterday, my currency lost its value for the last 5 years. Being a Vietnamese is tough.<br />
</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Moreover, I also write a quick note here as a to-do list, if you find sth missing, inform me through the comment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a good benchmark on how memcache can really save the day.</li>
<li>Although the link is automatically linked, it still breaks the layout if the URL is too long, need to truncate the URL (not easy with those php preg_replace functions :( )</li>
<li>Need to add dynamic meta keywords to improve page SEO as well.</li>
<li>Improve URL routing system.</li>
<li>Fix current CSS tooltip, an alternative is using an AJAXed one to save bandwidth.</li>
</ul>
