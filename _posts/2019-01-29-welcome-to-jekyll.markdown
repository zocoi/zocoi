I finally had time to move my blog to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static website generator and had it hosted on Netlify. I want my personal website to be easily customizable and ad-free. Wordpress was working fine but I find its limitation and its choice of ads annoying. For better UI, the Jekyll admin gem help to write Markdown in a breeze.
