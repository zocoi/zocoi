<p>Every book now has its own external reader that you can embed in any website to share with others. Usually, all you need to do is copying the code from the book page and paste it into your website.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-30" title="guide02" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/guide02.jpg" alt="" width="273" height="169" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately, not every forum and blog allows HTML code due to some security issues. However, most of them support the convenient tag <code>[flash][/flash]</code></p>
<blockquote><p><code>[flash]http://somesites.com/flash.swf[/flash]</code></p></blockquote>
<p>All you need is a simple hack with those tag by copying the book code</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-31" title="guide03" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/guide03-300x30.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="30" /></p>
<p>And append it to flash url like this</p>
<blockquote><p><code>[flash]http://www.mahshelf.com/swf/external_player.swf?code=<span style="color:#ff6600;">kEukYkEqk4</span>[/flash]</code></p></blockquote>
<p>There you go, enjoy sharing your books!</p>
