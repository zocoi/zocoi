<p>Being a web developer, I found myself trying to reset the DNS every time I added a new domain to the local server and wanted to see it right away.</p>
<p>Click on Start button and then type "cmd" in the search box, it should return only one result and that is your Command Prompt. Right click and choose "Run as administrator".</p>
<p>Once in the Command Prompt, type the following code and hit Enter, then you are good to go.</p>
<p>[sourcecode]<br />
ipconfig /flushdns<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
