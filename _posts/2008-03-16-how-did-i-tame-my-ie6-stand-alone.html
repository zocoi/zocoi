<p>Hooray,</p>
<p>Today morning, I wrote an entry about how difficult it is to have Firefox, IE7, IE6 and Safari running on a single machine. Now it is not really a matter anymore, thanks to someone has <a target="_blank" href="http://browsers.evolt.org/?ie/32bit/standalone">made a portable IE6</a>, I can have an old friend back. There is also a Windows version of Safari 3, but it is still at beta stage and for some unknown reasons it crashed on my XP. (I will figure it out later.)</p>
<p>There are couples of tweaks need to be done before having IE6 operate properly. You can follow it <a target="_blank" href="http://www.positioniseverything.net/articles/multiIE.html">here</a> to enable cookies, append a "IE 6" title to the browser and fix the <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537512.aspx">conditional comments</a> feature in CSS. Life is just half beautiful again.</p>
<p>Later on, I found a Javascript bug on my site and, well, it is time to google for a good IE script debugger, I found <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jonathanboutelle.com/mt/archives/2006/01/howto_debug_jav.html">this</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.klauskomenda.com/archives/2007/08/17/debugging-ie/">this</a>, and decided to use <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=92716">IE Developer Toolbar</a> and <a href="http://www.debugbar.com/">Debug Bar</a> since it looks neat and user-friendly. The functionality is somehow similar to the commendable Firebug of Firefox. If there is any problem, Script Debugger for Windows is my first candidate in the waiting list.</p>
