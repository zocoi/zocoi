<p>When I was a normal web surfer, I never thought it would be a critical issue for web page to display correctly on every browser. But recently it comes to me as a head-ache matter when designing the layout of <a href="http://www.mahshelf.com" target="_blank">mahshelf.com</a>. Luckily there is a javascript file that makes IE5-6 behave like a standard compliant browser. Although the situation about web design is temporarily stable, I am still looking a talented web designer in the future.</p>
<p>PS: I made a quick look at <a title="browser statistics" href="http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp" target="_blank">browser statistics</a> table and in this month, IE5-6 browser users are continuously decreasing.</p>
