<p>First we would like to say sorry for the inconvenience brought by the outage. Amazon, our storage provider, is having a service disruption that's causing problems serving our comics and manga content.</p>
<p><a href="http://vnese.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/outage.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-36" title="outage" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/outage.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="246" /></a></p>
<p>As far as we know, Amazon storage has been very stable, we have not encountered any service downtime since the beginning of MahShelf and they offer an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=379654011">SLA for the S3 service</a>, guaranteeing 99.9% uptime.  You can keep track of their efforts over on their own <a href="http://status.aws.amazon.com/">Status Dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we will release a newer version of MahShelf after the outage. Possibly we will fix some minor errors and improve some user interface experiences. Please bare with us and come back after a while, we know this is no fun, and weâ€™re truly sorry of what happened.</p>
