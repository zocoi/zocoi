    Hung,\r\n\r\nI’m one of the co-founders of Timehop, a simple yet powerful product
    that answers the question \"What did you do 1 year ago today?\" We’re looking
    to add another awesome engineer to our tight-knit team of five so I thought I’d
    reach out.\r\n\r\nTimehop helps people uncover their life story through their
    digital history by aggregating your personal data from Foursquare, Facebook, Twitter,
    Instagram, and text messages. So far, people really love us and we have big plans
    to do lots more.\r\n\r\nOur team hails from Gilt Groupe (me!), Zynga, Groupme,
    Loosecubes and the Barbarian Group, with the same awesome investors as Twitter,
    Foursquare and Tumblr, and angels that include the Foursquare and Groupme founders.\r\n\r\nThis
    is a great opportunity for an engineer who wants to conceive, build, own and deploy
    projects from the ground up as part of a nimble team of five. We’re hoping our
    next addition to the team loves beer, karaoke, and creating new, exciting products
    as much as we do.\r\n\r\nAre you free to jump on the phone Monday or Tuesday next
    week? Would love to learn more about what you’re doing and introduce you to Timehop
    more. Let me know if either day would work!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nBenny\";}"
