    by console and PC Devs interested in bringing that quality of game play to the
    touch screen generation? A small engineering team (less than a dozen) which has
    a great mix of very senior console devs who have been at the Dir. level but now
    want to build something great and lasting? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy name is Arthur

    equal if not surpass our competition and rule the world! Would you be interested
    in joining us is this endeavor? No one else is attempting this mission and putting
